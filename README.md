  Here is the video demonstrating this API. I also managed to fulfill the bonus objective of deleting a user's associated thoughts when the user is deleted.

  ## Description
  This is an API using NoSql and Mongoose. It is designed for a social media website, and through a database can managed Users (including friendships between users), Thoughts (the project's naming for a post), and Reactions to these thoughts.
 
  ## Usage
  Clone the project, navigate to it and type into your terminal "npm i" to install node. Then enet nodemon or npm start to start the server. After than, navigate to insomnia to try out the routes.
